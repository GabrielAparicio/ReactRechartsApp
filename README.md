# Gabriel Frontend Programming Task

I implemented the task as fast as I could, even though I didn't focus on styling and design I included some responsiveness using Material UI.

To run the task just follow these steps:

* yarn install
* yarn start

## Dependecies

* React Hook Form to implement form state efficiently
* Mock Service Worker to mock http requests and implement some testing (for LoadingView and Overview components)
* React Error Boundary to implement error views (for Overview component)
* Redux toolkit to implement state management quickly
* Eslint for linting and Prettier for formatting
* Typescript for static typing
